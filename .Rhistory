#> 1: : Dear Parliament! Good day! I welcome you, our invited guests, all citizens of the country and all those who are watching the inaugural session of the National Assembly from here and beyond. I am opening the inaugural session of the National Assembly. (The sounds of the music become louder, those in the hall stand up and sing the National Anthem together.) Dear House! Dear friends! I respectfully greet you, the freely and democratically elected representatives of the second Parliament of the new Hungarian Republic. First of all, let me state proudly - I think, in agreement with you - the indisputable fact that during the 1994 representative election, in terms of its cleanness and execution, it took place flawlessly and smoothly, the strength and maturity of our democracy, and the high participation rate of the two rounds of our people it proves his interest in his own fate, the determined intention and awareness of his political expression. For all of this, thanks go to all the voters, the leaders and candidate representatives of the parties that participated in the election, the leaders of the National Election Committee that conducted the election - by name, primarily Dr. Professor János Németh - and his members, the leaders and members of all local election committees, the National Electoral Office that prepares the elections - by name Dr. Mr. Zoltán Tóth and Dr. Mrs. Ilona Pálffy and their excellent colleagues - all the colleagues of the Ministry of the Interior and local governments who were part of the election work, as well as the many thousands of volunteer workers, without whose self-sacrificing cooperation we would hardly be sitting here today. And let me thank the appointed representatives of the six parliamentary parties for the series of negotiations that took place in a short time and required mutual goodwill and flexibility, with which today's session was prepared - with the professional help of the General Secretariat of the Parliament and the Office of the Parliament. This series of negotiations, I feel, foreshadows the goal-setting working style of the new Parliament, which is expected to be ready for cross-party cooperation. The National Assembly is our country's highest public law body, which is ultimately responsible for its legislative work to the people of the country and, let me add: the country's future. He does his work in front of the eyes and ears of the people, and what he does determines our everyday life. Its basis is the past, its test is the present, its judge is the future. The electorate forms an opinion about it every day, even if it formulates its collective verdict four years later, at another election. No one can doubt the legality of your work, but you have to fight for its recognition with your words and votes every day during debates. It is up to you how the citizens of the country, Hungarians and non-Hungarians, judge the functioning of our democracy. And not only the citizens of the country - the universal Hungarians, also our compatriots living outside our borders, who are connected to us not by a legal bond, but by the past, the common language and culture, the millions of threads of the community of destiny, their interest in existence. Please do not forget for a moment that the legislative task and responsibility of the National Assembly does not raise it above the country and society, but obliges it to serve it! The National Assembly as a whole and each of its members is an inseparable member of society, and even if it is constantly shaped by its work, it is also shaped along with it - and is also a reflection of it. And although the legislative work of the National Assembly is mostly embodied in a legal form, it is changed by human and economic relations in everyday life, from which it directly follows that the essential tool and true breeding ground of their daily work is the accurate knowledge of the naked social reality, which no ideology can replace. It is not my task to summarize the experiences of the previous Parliament's four-year work or even to try to allude to it. (10.10) I will not undertake to give an answer to the question that always arises: did the people of the country vote for something or against something. But this much, I think, I can safely say that he voted for the expected future, just as he also wants to see his future as certain and predictable, and as peaceful - and as soon as possible -, one that takes him forward in time and not backward, and that the from the past - from any kind of past - he is ready to incorporate as much into his future as will make it stronger socially and economically, and which is in line with his moral value judgment. Because his natural wisdom demands social justice, sane equality of opportunity - he doesn't expect miracles or fried pigeons. You can sense good intentions, true words, dialogue, a say in the fate of property, even more so public purity. And make sure that they recognize all of this - as well as their opponent - verbally, in writing, and on screen. My recent conversations with the leaders of the six parliamentary parties, the tough discussions and the outcome of the coalition negotiations have convinced me that both the parties of the future government coalition and the future opposition are aware of the country's problems, the - by no means easy - tasks ahead of us, and they judge them similarly. the order of importance of the tasks of the National Assembly, so they are ready for fruitful dialogue, constructive debate and cooperation. Finally, I ask for God's blessing on the work of the National Assembly. I wish from the bottom of my heart to all the members of the House that what you do as a representative of the national assembly will benefit our country even if measured by the standards of your own conscience. (Applause.) Dear Parliament! I announce that in accordance with Section 2 (1) of the Rules of the House, 383 elected representatives have submitted their credentials by the time of the inaugural meeting. Dear Parliament! Pursuant to § 4 of the House Rules, until the election of the officers, the constituent meeting is chaired by the group president, and the four youngest representatives perform the secretarial tasks as the group registrars. As far as I know, the oldest representative is Dr. László Varga, representative of the Christian Democratic People's Party. (Applause.) The four youngest representatives: László Botka (MSZP), Tamás Deutsch (Fidesz), Péter Nahimi (MDF) and József Rimóczi (MSZP). I would like to ask the honorable Parliament if they are aware of anything else, are these data accurate? (No one applies.) Dear Parliament! To fulfill the duties of the co-chairman, Dr. I am asking representative László Varga, and the clerkship duties will be performed alternately by representatives László Botka and Tamás Deutsch, Péter Nahimi and József Rimóczi. I made the credentials available to the class president and the class registrars for the purpose of mandate examination. With this, I will hand over the leadership of the meeting to the co-chairman of the Parliament, and the two consecutive co-registrars will be Péter Nahimi and József Rimóczi. (Applause. - The President of the Republic, leaving the rostrum, shakes hands with Dr. László Varga, who is standing at the steps of the platform, and then takes his place according to the order of the meeting. - The president of the quorum, the quorum clerks and the secretary general of the National Assembly take their place at the presidential rostrum.)

#> 1: : Dear Parliament! Good day! I welcome you, our invited guests, all citizens of the country and all those who are watching the inaugural session of the National Assembly from here and beyond. I am opening the inaugural session of the National Assembly. (The sounds of the music become louder, those in the hall stand up and sing the National Anthem together.) Dear House! Dear friends! I respectfully greet you, the freely and democratically elected representatives of the second Parliament of the new Hungarian Republic. First of all, let me state proudly - I think, in agreement with you - the indisputable fact that during the 1994 representative election, in terms of its cleanness and execution, it took place flawlessly and smoothly, the strength and maturity of our democracy, and the high participation rate of the two rounds of our people it proves his interest in his own fate, the determined intention and awareness of his political expression. For all of this, thanks go to all the voters, the leaders and candidate representatives of the parties that participated in the election, the leaders of the National Election Committee that conducted the election - by name, primarily Dr. Professor János Németh - and his members, the leaders and members of all local election committees, the National Electoral Office that prepares the elections - by name Dr. Mr. Zoltán Tóth and Dr. Mrs. Ilona Pálffy and their excellent colleagues - all the colleagues of the Ministry of the Interior and local governments who were part of the election work, as well as the many thousands of volunteer workers, without whose self-sacrificing cooperation we would hardly be sitting here today. And let me thank the appointed representatives of the six parliamentary parties for the series of negotiations that took place in a short time and required mutual goodwill and flexibility, with which today's session was prepared - with the professional help of the General Secretariat of the Parliament and the Office of the Parliament. This series of negotiations, I feel, foreshadows the goal-setting working style of the new Parliament, which is expected to be ready for cross-party cooperation. The National Assembly is our country's highest public law body, which is ultimately responsible for its legislative work to the people of the country and, let me add: the country's future. He does his work in front of the eyes and ears of the people, and what he does determines our everyday life. Its basis is the past, its test is the present, its judge is the future. The electorate forms an opinion about it every day, even if it formulates its collective verdict four years later, at another election. No one can doubt the legality of your work, but you have to fight for its recognition with your words and votes every day during debates. It is up to you how the citizens of the country, Hungarians and non-Hungarians, judge the functioning of our democracy. And not only the citizens of the country - the universal Hungarians, also our compatriots living outside our borders, who are connected to us not by a legal bond, but by the past, the common language and culture, the millions of threads of the community of destiny, their interest in existence. Please do not forget for a moment that the legislative task and responsibility of the National Assembly does not raise it above the country and society, but obliges it to serve it! The National Assembly as a whole and each of its members is an inseparable member of society, and even if it is constantly shaped by its work, it is also shaped along with it - and is also a reflection of it. And although the legislative work of the National Assembly is mostly embodied in a legal form, it is changed by human and economic relations in everyday life, from which it directly follows that the essential tool and true breeding ground of their daily work is the accurate knowledge of the naked social reality, which no ideology can replace. It is not my task to summarize the experiences of the previous Parliament's four-year work or even to try to allude to it. (10.10) I will not undertake to give an answer to the question that always arises: did the people of the country vote for something or against something. But this much, I think, I can safely say that he voted for the expected future, just as he also wants to see his future as certain and predictable, and as peaceful - and as soon as possible -, one that takes him forward in time and not backward, and that the from the past - from any kind of past - he is ready to incorporate as much into his future as will make it stronger socially and economically, and which is in line with his moral value judgment. Because his natural wisdom demands social justice, sane equality of opportunity - he doesn't expect miracles or fried pigeons. You can sense good intentions, true words, dialogue, a say in the fate of property, even more so public purity. And make sure that they recognize all of this - as well as their opponent - verbally, in writing, and on screen. My recent conversations with the leaders of the six parliamentary parties, the tough discussions and the outcome of the coalition negotiations have convinced me that both the parties of the future government coalition and the future opposition are aware of the country's problems, the - by no means easy - tasks ahead of us, and they judge them similarly. the order of importance of the tasks of the National Assembly, so they are ready for fruitful dialogue, constructive debate and cooperation. Finally, I ask for God's blessing on the work of the National Assembly. I wish from the bottom of my heart to all the members of the House that what you do as a representative of the national assembly will benefit our country even if measured by the standards of your own conscience. (Applause.) Dear Parliament! I announce that in accordance with Section 2 (1) of the Rules of the House, 383 elected representatives have submitted their credentials by the time of the inaugural meeting. Dear Parliament! Pursuant to § 4 of the House Rules, until the election of the officers, the constituent meeting is chaired by the group president, and the four youngest representatives perform the secretarial tasks as the group registrars. As far as I know, the oldest representative is Dr. László Varga, representative of the Christian Democratic People's Party. (Applause.) The four youngest representatives: László Botka (MSZP), Tamás Deutsch (Fidesz), Péter Nahimi (MDF) and József Rimóczi (MSZP). I would like to ask the honorable Parliament if they are aware of anything else, are these data accurate? (No one applies.) Dear Parliament! To fulfill the duties of the co-chairman, Dr. I am asking representative László Varga, and the clerkship duties will be performed alternately by representatives László Botka and Tamás Deutsch, Péter Nahimi and József Rimóczi. I made the credentials available to the class president and the class registrars for the purpose of mandate examination. With this, I will hand over the leadership of the meeting to the co-chairman of the Parliament, and the two consecutive co-registrars will be Péter Nahimi and József Rimóczi. (Applause. - The President of the Republic, leaving the rostrum, shakes hands with Dr. László Varga, who is standing at the steps of the platform, and then takes his place according to the order of the meeting. - The president of the quorum, the quorum clerks and the secretary general of the National Assembly take their place at the presidential rostrum.)

#> 1: ÁRPÁD GÖNCZ, President of the Republic of Hungary (from the podium): Dear Parliament! Good day! I welcome you, our invited guests, all citizens of the country and all those who are watching the inaugural session of the National Assembly from here and beyond. I am opening the inaugural session of the National Assembly. (The sounds of the music become louder, those in the hall stand up and sing the National Anthem together.) Dear House! Dear friends! I respectfully greet you, the freely and democratically elected representatives of the second Parliament of the new Hungarian Republic. First of all, let me state proudly - I think, in agreement with you - the indisputable fact that during the 1994 representative election, in terms of its cleanness and execution, it took place flawlessly and smoothly, the strength and maturity of our democracy, and the high participation rate of the two rounds of our people it proves his interest in his own fate, the determined intention and awareness of his political expression. For all of this, thanks go to all the voters, the leaders and candidate representatives of the parties that participated in the election, the leaders of the National Election Committee that conducted the election - by name, primarily Dr. Professor János Németh - and his members, the leaders and members of all local election committees, the National Electoral Office that prepares the elections - by name Dr. Mr. Zoltán Tóth and Dr. Mrs. Ilona Pálffy and their excellent colleagues - all the colleagues of the Ministry of the Interior and local governments who were part of the election work, as well as the many thousands of volunteer workers, without whose self-sacrificing cooperation we would hardly be sitting here today. And let me thank the appointed representatives of the six parliamentary parties for the series of negotiations that took place in a short time and required mutual goodwill and flexibility, with which today's session was prepared - with the professional help of the General Secretariat of the Parliament and the Office of the Parliament. This series of negotiations, I feel, foreshadows the goal-setting working style of the new Parliament, which is expected to be ready for cross-party cooperation. The National Assembly is our country's highest public law body, which is ultimately responsible for its legislative work to the people of the country and, let me add: the country's future. He does his work in front of the eyes and ears of the people, and what he does determines our everyday life. Its basis is the past, its test is the present, its judge is the future. The electorate forms an opinion about it every day, even if it formulates its collective verdict four years later, at another election. No one can doubt the legality of your work, but you have to fight for its recognition with your words and votes every day during debates. It is up to you how the citizens of the country, Hungarians and non-Hungarians, judge the functioning of our democracy. And not only the citizens of the country - the universal Hungarians, also our compatriots living outside our borders, who are connected to us not by a legal bond, but by the past, the common language and culture, the millions of threads of the community of destiny, their interest in existence. Please do not forget for a moment that the legislative task and responsibility of the National Assembly does not raise it above the country and society, but obliges it to serve it! The National Assembly as a whole and each of its members is an inseparable member of society, and even if it is constantly shaped by its work, it is also shaped along with it - and is also a reflection of it. And although the legislative work of the National Assembly is mostly embodied in a legal form, it is changed by human and economic relations in everyday life, from which it directly follows that the essential tool and true breeding ground of their daily work is the accurate knowledge of the naked social reality, which no ideology can replace. It is not my task to summarize the experiences of the previous Parliament's four-year work or even to try to allude to it. (10.10) I will not undertake to give an answer to the question that always arises: did the people of the country vote for something or against something. But this much, I think, I can safely say that he voted for the expected future, just as he also wants to see his future as certain and predictable, and as peaceful - and as soon as possible -, one that takes him forward in time and not backward, and that the from the past - from any kind of past - he is ready to incorporate as much into his future as will make it stronger socially and economically, and which is in line with his moral value judgment. Because his natural wisdom demands social justice, sane equality of opportunity - he doesn't expect miracles or fried pigeons. You can sense good intentions, true words, dialogue, a say in the fate of property, even more so public purity. And make sure that they recognize all of this - as well as their opponent - verbally, in writing, and on screen. My recent conversations with the leaders of the six parliamentary parties, the tough discussions and the outcome of the coalition negotiations have convinced me that both the parties of the future government coalition and the future opposition are aware of the country's problems, the - by no means easy - tasks ahead of us, and they judge them similarly. the order of importance of the tasks of the National Assembly, so they are ready for fruitful dialogue, constructive debate and cooperation. Finally, I ask for God's blessing on the work of the National Assembly. I wish from the bottom of my heart to all the members of the House that what you do as a representative of the national assembly will benefit our country even if measured by the standards of your own conscience. (Applause.) Dear Parliament! I announce that in accordance with Section 2 (1) of the Rules of the House, 383 elected representatives have submitted their credentials by the time of the inaugural meeting. Dear Parliament! Pursuant to § 4 of the House Rules, until the election of the officers, the constituent meeting is chaired by the group president, and the four youngest representatives perform the secretarial tasks as the group registrars. As far as I know, the oldest representative is Dr. László Varga, representative of the Christian Democratic People's Party. (Applause.) The four youngest representatives: László Botka (MSZP), Tamás Deutsch (Fidesz), Péter Nahimi (MDF) and József Rimóczi (MSZP). I would like to ask the honorable Parliament if they are aware of anything else, are these data accurate? (No one applies.) Dear Parliament! To fulfill the duties of the co-chairman, Dr. I am asking representative László Varga, and the clerkship duties will be performed alternately by representatives László Botka and Tamás Deutsch, Péter Nahimi and József Rimóczi. I made the credentials available to the class president and the class registrars for the purpose of mandate examination. With this, I will hand over the leadership of the meeting to the co-chairman of the Parliament, and the two consecutive co-registrars will be Péter Nahimi and József Rimóczi. (Applause. - The President of the Republic, leaving the rostrum, shakes hands with Dr. László Varga, who is standing at the steps of the platform, and then takes his place according to the order of the meeting. - The president of the quorum, the quorum clerks and the secretary general of the National Assembly take their place at the presidential rostrum.)

#> 1: Dr. LÁSZLÓ VARGA, co-speaker of the Parliamentary Assembly, henceforth president (stand and deliver his speech): Mr. President! Dear Parliament! I gratefully accept the seniority due to my years, but please don't take it as bias that - as a legacy to my trans-Danubian parents, who farmed a few acres when I was young, and lived on a tight budget: my mother, Anna Tóth, born in Egyházaskesző, my father, Géza Varga, born in Csorna, and by the grace of the Almighty - now , today I feel like a registrar. Forty-seven years ago, I sat on the right side of the National Assembly as a representative of the Democratic People's Party, the legal predecessor of today's Christian Democratic People's Party. In the second post-war election campaign in 1947, the Democratic People's Party emerged victorious, with sixty-two representatives, based on clear votes. Although we were the largest party in the country, we could not think of forming a government because of the occupation: we fought in the opposition so that citizens could exercise their fundamental rights without fear and freely, that our culture would be strengthened, that the creative individual should be the engine of our economic life; we protected the fruits of labor, private property - adding that every income includes social justice, which ensures the decent life and human dignity of workers -; furthermore, that the education of the youth should be based on knowledge, while their education should be based on the national spirit and Christian values. We could not achieve our goal because of the occupation, and as the repression in the country intensified, the anxiety of the citizens increased, and then the moment came when we were already afraid, I was afraid. It was a cruel feeling to realize that life ends where fear begins: there is only existence. And we focused all our thoughts and nerves on getting rid of the life-sapping feeling of fear. Poverty is an undesirable state, but in the course of history immortal works have been born in deprivation - never in fear, because terror kills all creative forces. The source of fear is arbitrariness and oppression, against which our people move almost every hundred years in its history. (10.20) I somewhat boldly list the XIII. the Golden Bull era of the 19th century, when the ruling orders protested against the arbitrariness of the king, later the uprisings of Antal Nagy Budai, György Dózsa, Ferenc Tokaji, then the freedom struggles of Rákóczi and Kossuth, just like in '56, the struggles against arbitrariness and oppression. The past and mentioned uprisings and freedom struggles have apparently failed. In reality, no, because every noble, selfless, sacrificial act will bear fruit sooner or later, and it will turn green even on the rock. Without Kossuth's struggle for freedom, there is no compromise, just as in 1956 he decisively contributed to the collapse of the communist system, but at the same time the whole world bowed down to Hungarianness and we regained our national respect. I pay tribute to all the legislators of 1947 who fought for our nation, such as István Barankovics, secretary general of the Democratic People's Party, dr. To Sándor Eckhardt, university professor, dr. Ferenc Mateovics, who is suffering from a terminal illness today; He spent 19 and a half years in prison for his principles, and when I asked him how he felt about those who caused his suffering, he replied: "Repent of your mistakes and sins and love your neighbors!" All I add to this behavior is that I respectfully bow my head before Paul, who became a Saul, I turn away from Sauls who speak Paul and I abhor Sauls who live in hatred and revenge. I also remember Zoltán Pfeiffer, the president of the Hungarian Independence Party, Imre Kovács, the author of "The Silent Revolution", Anna Kéthly, a social democrat from the coalition government, who as the vice-president of the National Assembly, bravely and boldly defended the opposition's freedom of speech. I think with grace of Imre Nagy, the Speaker of the National Assembly, whose opening speech was celebrated much more enthusiastically in the opposition than his own party. We felt his Hungarianness, the love of his people. He paid for it with his life. I think with gratitude of all those who during our 1100-year history sacrificed their freedom and their lives for our nation and those who during the last 40 years of occupation - on any side - and who made it possible with their work during the four years that we are here today, in an independent and free country to work for our nation. I respectfully remember the present Monsignor Béla Varga, the former president of the National Assembly, whose whole life was work for his people. (Prolonged applause. - Béla Varga stands up to thank the applause.) We must democratically accept the results of the 1994 elections, but at least acknowledge them. At the same time, the newly formed Government must also accept, or at least acknowledge, that power belongs to the people and that the Government's only task is to serve the people. Citizens' trust can only be enjoyed by those who preserve the independence of our country, ensure the exercise of the people's fundamental rights and the enforcement of social justice, increase knowledge, support education with a national spirit, and the educational and educational work of the historic churches. And last but not least, during this period of the National Assembly, during the four years, we will build the stronghold of our culture, the National Theatre, or at least start building it. Our democracy is not strengthened by the power of the Government, but when citizens exercise their rights not only in elections and through their representatives, but also in social, advocacy, cultural and other associations. Without it, all governments are prone to arbitrariness. President! Dear Parliament! Our people yearn for security, internal peace, and an improvement in our economic situation, and they rightly demand selfless and sacrificial work from all representatives. Since no party has a panacea to solve all difficulties, we must strive to reach an agreement on issues of public interest. The security of our country is not currently guaranteed by international treaties, and although we are not threatened by external threats, due to the almost never-ending cruel civil war in the former Yugoslavia - and because the forces of power in the former Soviet Union have not yet been clarified - it is necessary that even the Western European Through the Union or rather from NATO, we should get security so that we are not alone in case of danger. Our common cause is also the situation of minorities living outside our borders. We are the same in their history, language, and culture, so their fate is ours. I think we agree that it is the duty of all of us in international documents, such as the United Nations General Assembly l992. in its decision of December 18, to fight together for the rights granted to national minorities. Anyone who listens to this question will be hit by Babits' biblical judgment: "He who is silent is an accomplice among sinners." The path of our economic improvement and development is marked by the European Union, of which there are still twelve today, but soon the neighboring Austria and three other countries will join, which are often different in their history, language and interests, but by preserving their independence - and making sacrifices - the free man based on their business and production, they live in peace, democracy and satisfactory economic conditions. The average annual income of citizens of the European Union is more than HUF one million. Our country is an associate member of the European Union and we are moving towards full membership, so we are also guided by the principles and results that promoted the development of the members of the European Union. These prove that the state is not a good farmer. It is arbitrary, bureaucratic, slow and lacking in ideas. Keeping in mind the looming nationalization of the socialist system, we still have to strive for the state to hand over everything it can to the entrepreneurial citizen and to keep only what is necessary and not the other way around. In economic life, unlimited liberalism, the excesses and greed of the individual should be limited by social justice, which is more than social security, led by proportional and fair taxation. A country is not rich where there are many millionaires - even if there are some - but where there are no destitutes and few unemployed. Villas and palaces may be built, but the citizens of that country are contented and cheerful, where everyone has their own home, and young married people do not have to wait for years to spend the most beautiful period of their lives in their home. In our colorful and rich language, home means not only the apartment, but also the homeland. Based on what has been said, I believe that in a young democracy, the voters do not want to listen to unnecessary battles of words, nor do they want to see the empty fight between the Government and the opposition, but rather who does more for our people. For this purpose, it would be correct if the Government accepted all the proposals of the opposition that serve the public good, but at the same time the opposition should not protest against the Government's legislative proposal, the implementation of which is in the public interest. We are all here because of the people's trust. Trust is the most beautiful gift of life, which we are only worthy of if we serve our nation selflessly and sacrificially. Let there be no one among us who obtains a financial advantage from his position as a representative! If there is such a thing, let's get rid of it, because the voters want our work to benefit the country and not the representative! In this spirit - with my wife's consent - I will use my representative's salary for the construction costs of the National Theater and to help the needy. (Applause. - Continuous noise.) One of the conditions for the country's peace is that the non-armed powerhouse of our time, the electronic news service, should not serve the government or the opposition, but should inform the citizens objectively, fairly and ethically. This is the source of healthy public spirit - which is the spiritual current circulating between the Government and the people. (10.30) I believe that we also agree that we fight against all extremism. The strength of the extremes is that they preach attractive truths, but the goal is not to realize them, but to gain power. When they come to power, they are silent about the truths, and the arbitrariness of the legal guardian remains. I am convinced that all members of the National Assembly agree with me that there will be no reorganization in our country; but I will add that it cannot be, because the events that took place in the former socialist countries prove that development has passed through the outdated political system of communism, its extinguished idea will not be rekindled, and its economic system, which has fallen into the abyss, will not recover. President! Dear Parliament! The eyes of the citizens of our country are on us, the Hungarian minorities outside the borders, as well as our compatriots living in emigration and making many sacrifices for our nation, as well as European and overseas governments, are also watching our activities. It is our duty to protect the reputation of our country abroad, and at home to fight our opposites in a noble struggle, and the winner should not be a person, a party, the Government or the opposition, but our beloved country. Finally, allow me to close this very rare occasion with a personal confession. The struggles, glory and defeats of our history: my textbook. I happily and abundantly draw from our culture, which is contemporary with Christianity. Our beautiful language is the only written and spoken expression of my thoughts; in my difficulty, my frailty, my downfall, Christianity remained my guide. I belong to this nation, I am from the people, I live among the people and I work for the people. Nazism put me in prison, Communism drove me away, freedom brought me back. I thank the heavens and all my loyal compatriots that I can finish my public work where I started, at home. Thanks. (Prolonged applause.) Dear Parliament! Paragraph (5) of § 20 of the Constitution, as well as LV. 1990 on the legal status of representatives of the National Assembly. the law provides for conflicts of interest related to the office of representative. The representative group of the six parliamentary parties - if they allow me, I won't use the word faction because I don't like it - agreed that at the inaugural meeting we should present the list of representatives who have a conflict of interest, as well as the list of those who have eliminated the conflict of interest in the meantime. I would like to ask my representative, the age registrar, to introduce the list. Contents Previous Next Start Homepage

#> 1: : Dear Parliament! Good day! I welcome you, our invited guests, all citizens of the country and all those who are watching the inaugural session of the National Assembly from here and beyond. I am opening the inaugural session of the National Assembly. (The sounds of the music become louder, those in the hall stand up and sing the National Anthem together.) Dear House! Dear friends! I respectfully greet you, the freely and democratically elected representatives of the second Parliament of the new Hungarian Republic. First of all, let me state proudly - I think, in agreement with you - the indisputable fact that during the 1994 representative election, in terms of its cleanness and execution, it took place flawlessly and smoothly, the strength and maturity of our democracy, and the high participation rate of the two rounds of our people it proves his interest in his own fate, the determined intention and awareness of his political expression. For all of this, thanks go to all the voters, the leaders and candidate representatives of the parties that participated in the election, the leaders of the National Election Committee that conducted the election - by name, primarily Dr. Professor János Németh - and his members, the leaders and members of all local election committees, the National Electoral Office that prepares the elections - by name Dr. Mr. Zoltán Tóth and Dr. Mrs. Ilona Pálffy and their excellent colleagues - all the colleagues of the Ministry of the Interior and local governments who were part of the election work, as well as the many thousands of volunteer workers, without whose self-sacrificing cooperation we would hardly be sitting here today. And let me thank the appointed representatives of the six parliamentary parties for the series of negotiations that took place in a short time and required mutual goodwill and flexibility, with which today's session was prepared - with the professional help of the General Secretariat of the Parliament and the Office of the Parliament. This series of negotiations, I feel, foreshadows the goal-setting working style of the new Parliament, which is expected to be ready for cross-party cooperation. The National Assembly is our country's highest public law body, which is ultimately responsible for its legislative work to the people of the country and, let me add: the country's future. He does his work in front of the eyes and ears of the people, and what he does determines our everyday life. Its basis is the past, its test is the present, its judge is the future. The electorate forms an opinion about it every day, even if it formulates its collective verdict four years later, at another election. No one can doubt the legality of your work, but you have to fight for its recognition with your words and votes every day during debates. It is up to you how the citizens of the country, Hungarians and non-Hungarians, judge the functioning of our democracy. And not only the citizens of the country - the universal Hungarians, also our compatriots living outside our borders, who are connected to us not by a legal bond, but by the past, the common language and culture, the millions of threads of the community of destiny, their interest in existence. Please do not forget for a moment that the legislative task and responsibility of the National Assembly does not raise it above the country and society, but obliges it to serve it! The National Assembly as a whole and each of its members is an inseparable member of society, and even if it is constantly shaped by its work, it is also shaped along with it - and is also a reflection of it. And although the legislative work of the National Assembly is mostly embodied in a legal form, it is changed by human and economic relations in everyday life, from which it directly follows that the essential tool and true breeding ground of their daily work is the accurate knowledge of the naked social reality, which no ideology can replace. It is not my task to summarize the experiences of the previous Parliament's four-year work or even to try to allude to it. (10.10) I will not undertake to give an answer to the question that always arises: did the people of the country vote for something or against something. But this much, I think, I can safely say that he voted for the expected future, just as he also wants to see his future as certain and predictable, and as peaceful - and as soon as possible -, one that takes him forward in time and not backward, and that the from the past - from any kind of past - he is ready to incorporate as much into his future as will make it stronger socially and economically, and which is in line with his moral value judgment. Because his natural wisdom demands social justice, sane equality of opportunity - he doesn't expect miracles or fried pigeons. You can sense good intentions, true words, dialogue, a say in the fate of property, even more so public purity. And make sure that they recognize all of this - as well as their opponent - verbally, in writing, and on screen. My recent conversations with the leaders of the six parliamentary parties, the tough discussions and the outcome of the coalition negotiations have convinced me that both the parties of the future government coalition and the future opposition are aware of the country's problems, the - by no means easy - tasks ahead of us, and they judge them similarly. the order of importance of the tasks of the National Assembly, so they are ready for fruitful dialogue, constructive debate and cooperation. Finally, I ask for God's blessing on the work of the National Assembly. I wish from the bottom of my heart to all the members of the House that what you do as a representative of the national assembly will benefit our country even if measured by the standards of your own conscience. (Applause.) Dear Parliament! I announce that in accordance with Section 2 (1) of the Rules of the House, 383 elected representatives have submitted their credentials by the time of the inaugural meeting. Dear Parliament! Pursuant to § 4 of the House Rules, until the election of the officers, the constituent meeting is chaired by the group president, and the four youngest representatives perform the secretarial tasks as the group registrars. As far as I know, the oldest representative is Dr. László Varga, representative of the Christian Democratic People's Party. (Applause.) The four youngest representatives: László Botka (MSZP), Tamás Deutsch (Fidesz), Péter Nahimi (MDF) and József Rimóczi (MSZP). I would like to ask the honorable Parliament if they are aware of anything else, are these data accurate? (No one applies.) Dear Parliament! To fulfill the duties of the co-chairman, Dr. I am asking representative László Varga, and the clerkship duties will be performed alternately by representatives László Botka and Tamás Deutsch, Péter Nahimi and József Rimóczi. I made the credentials available to the class president and the class registrars for the purpose of mandate examination. With this, I will hand over the leadership of the meeting to the co-chairman of the Parliament, and the two consecutive co-registrars will be Péter Nahimi and József Rimóczi. (Applause. - The President of the Republic, leaving the rostrum, shakes hands with Dr. László Varga, who is standing at the steps of the platform, and then takes his place according to the order of the meeting. - The president of the quorum, the quorum clerks and the secretary general of the National Assembly take their place at the presidential rostrum.)

#> 1:  Dear Parliament Good day I welcome you our invited guests all citizens of the country and all those who are watching the inaugural session of the National Assembly from here and beyond I am opening the inaugural session of the National Assembly The sounds of the music become louder those in the hall stand up and sing the National Anthem together Dear House Dear friends I respectfully greet you the freely and democratically elected representatives of the second Parliament of the new Hungarian Republic First of all let me state proudly  I think in agreement with you  the indisputable fact that during the  representative election in terms of its cleanness and execution it took place flawlessly and smoothly the strength and maturity of our democracy and the high participation rate of the two rounds of our people it proves his interest in his own fate the determined intention and awareness of his political expression For all of this thanks go to all the voters the leaders and candidate representatives of the parties that participated in the election the leaders of the National Election Committee that conducted the election  by name primarily Dr Professor János Németh  and his members the leaders and members of all local election committees the National Electoral Office that prepares the elections  by name Dr Mr Zoltán Tóth and Dr Mrs Ilona Pálffy and their excellent colleagues  all the colleagues of the Ministry of the Interior and local governments who were part of the election work as well as the many thousands of volunteer workers without whose selfsacrificing cooperation we would hardly be sitting here today And let me thank the appointed representatives of the six parliamentary parties for the series of negotiations that took place in a short time and required mutual goodwill and flexibility with which todays session was prepared  with the professional help of the General Secretariat of the Parliament and the Office of the Parliament This series of negotiations I feel foreshadows the goalsetting working style of the new Parliament which is expected to be ready for crossparty cooperation The National Assembly is our countrys highest public law body which is ultimately responsible for its legislative work to the people of the country and let me add the countrys future He does his work in front of the eyes and ears of the people and what he does determines our everyday life Its basis is the past its test is the present its judge is the future The electorate forms an opinion about it every day even if it formulates its collective verdict four years later at another election No one can doubt the legality of your work but you have to fight for its recognition with your words and votes every day during debates It is up to you how the citizens of the country Hungarians and nonHungarians judge the functioning of our democracy And not only the citizens of the country  the universal Hungarians also our compatriots living outside our borders who are connected to us not by a legal bond but by the past the common language and culture the millions of threads of the community of destiny their interest in existence Please do not forget for a moment that the legislative task and responsibility of the National Assembly does not raise it above the country and society but obliges it to serve it The National Assembly as a whole and each of its members is an inseparable member of society and even if it is constantly shaped by its work it is also shaped along with it  and is also a reflection of it And although the legislative work of the National Assembly is mostly embodied in a legal form it is changed by human and economic relations in everyday life from which it directly follows that the essential tool and true breeding ground of their daily work is the accurate knowledge of the naked social reality which no ideology can replace It is not my task to summarize the experiences of the previous Parliaments fouryear work or even to try to allude to it  I will not undertake to give an answer to the question that always arises did the people of the country vote for something or against something But this much I think I can safely say that he voted for the expected future just as he also wants to see his future as certain and predictable and as peaceful  and as soon as possible  one that takes him forward in time and not backward and that the from the past  from any kind of past  he is ready to incorporate as much into his future as will make it stronger socially and economically and which is in line with his moral value judgment Because his natural wisdom demands social justice sane equality of opportunity  he doesnt expect miracles or fried pigeons You can sense good intentions true words dialogue a say in the fate of property even more so public purity And make sure that they recognize all of this  as well as their opponent  verbally in writing and on screen My recent conversations with the leaders of the six parliamentary parties the tough discussions and the outcome of the coalition negotiations have convinced me that both the parties of the future government coalition and the future opposition are aware of the countrys problems the  by no means easy  tasks ahead of us and they judge them similarly the order of importance of the tasks of the National Assembly so they are ready for fruitful dialogue constructive debate and cooperation Finally I ask for Gods blessing on the work of the National Assembly I wish from the bottom of my heart to all the members of the House that what you do as a representative of the national assembly will benefit our country even if measured by the standards of your own conscience Applause Dear Parliament I announce that in accordance with Section   of the Rules of the House  elected representatives have submitted their credentials by the time of the inaugural meeting Dear Parliament Pursuant to   of the House Rules until the election of the officers the constituent meeting is chaired by the group president and the four youngest representatives perform the secretarial tasks as the group registrars As far as I know the oldest representative is Dr László Varga representative of the Christian Democratic Peoples Party Applause The four youngest representatives László Botka MSZP Tamás Deutsch Fidesz Péter Nahimi MDF and József Rimóczi MSZP I would like to ask the honorable Parliament if they are aware of anything else are these data accurate No one applies Dear Parliament To fulfill the duties of the cochairman Dr I am asking representative László Varga and the clerkship duties will be performed alternately by representatives László Botka and Tamás Deutsch Péter Nahimi and József Rimóczi I made the credentials available to the class president and the class registrars for the purpose of mandate examination With this I will hand over the leadership of the meeting to the cochairman of the Parliament and the two consecutive coregistrars will be Péter Nahimi and József Rimóczi Applause  The President of the Republic leaving the rostrum shakes hands with Dr László Varga who is standing at

place at the presidential rostrum

#> 1: parliament good day i welcome you our invited guests all citizens of the country and all those who are watching the inaugural session of the national assembly from here and beyond i am opening the inaugural session of the national assembly the sounds of the music become louder those in the hall stand up and sing the national anthem together  house  friends i respectfully greet you the freely and democratically elected representatives of the second parliament of the new hungarian republic first of all let me state proudly  i think in agreement with you  the indisputable fact that during the  representative election in terms of its cleanness and execution it took place flawlessly and smoothly the strength and maturity of our democracy and the high participation rate of the two rounds of our people it proves his interest in his own fate the determined intention and awareness of his political expression for all of this thanks go to all the voters the leaders and candidate representatives of the parties that participated in the election the leaders of the national election committee that conducted the election  by name primarily dr professor jános németh  and his members the leaders and members of all local election committees the national electoral office that prepares the elections  by name dr mr zoltán tóth and dr mrs ilona pálffy and their excellent colleagues  all the colleagues of the ministry of the interior and local governments who were part of the election work as well as the many thousands of volunteer workers without whose selfsacrificing cooperation we would hardly be sitting here today and let me thank the appointed representatives of the six parliamentary parties for the series of negotiations that took place in a short time and required mutual goodwill and flexibility with which todays session was prepared  with the professional help of the general secretariat of the parliament and the office of the parliament this series of negotiations i feel foreshadows the goalsetting working style of the new parliament which is expected to be ready for crossparty cooperation the national assembly is our countrys highest public law body which is ultimately responsible for its legislative work to the people of the country and let me add the countrys future he does his work in front of the eyes and ears of the people and what he does determines our everyday life its basis is the past its test is the present its judge is the future the electorate forms an opinion about it every day even if it formulates its collective verdict four years later at another election no one can doubt the legality of your work but you have to fight for its recognition with your words and votes every day during debates it is up to you how the citizens of the country hungarians and nonhungarians judge the functioning of our democracy and not only the citizens of the country  the universal hungarians also our compatriots living outside our borders who are connected to us not by a legal bond but by the past the common language and culture the millions of threads of the community of destiny their interest in existence please do not forget for a moment that the legislative task and responsibility of the national assembly does not raise it above the country and society but obliges it to serve it the national assembly as a whole and each of its members is an inseparable member of society and even if it is constantly shaped by its work it is also shaped along with it  and is also a reflection of it and although the legislative work of the national assembly is mostly embodied in a legal form it is changed by human and economic relations in everyday life from which it directly follows that the essential tool and true breeding ground of their daily work is the accurate knowledge of the naked social reality which no ideology can replace it is not my task to summarize the experiences of the previous parliaments fouryear work or even to try to allude to it  i will not undertake to give an answer to the question that always arises did the people of the country vote for something or against something but this much i think i can safely say that he voted for the expected future just as he also wants to see his future as certain and predictable and as peaceful  and as soon as possible  one that takes him forward in time and not backward and that the from the past  from any kind of past  he is ready to incorporate as much into his future as will make it stronger socially and economically and which is in line with his moral value judgment because his natural wisdom demands social justice sane equality of opportunity  he doesnt expect miracles or fried pigeons you can sense good intentions true words dialogue a say in the fate of property even more so public purity and make sure that they recognize all of this  as well as their opponent  verbally in writing and on screen my recent conversations with the leaders of the six parliamentary parties the tough discussions and the outcome of the coalition negotiations have convinced me that both the parties of the future government coalition and the future opposition are aware of the countrys problems the  by no means easy  tasks ahead of us and they judge them similarly the order of importance of the tasks of the national assembly so they are ready for fruitful dialogue constructive debate and cooperation finally i ask for gods blessing on the work of the national assembly i wish from the bottom of my heart to all the members of the house that what you do as a representative of the national assembly will benefit our country even if measured by the standards of your own conscience applause  parliament i announce that in accordance with section   of the rules of the house  elected representatives have submitted their credentials by the time of the inaugural meeting  parliament pursuant to   of the house rules until the election of the officers the constituent meeting is chaired by the group president and the four youngest representatives perform the secretarial tasks as the group registrars as far as i know the oldest representative is dr lászló varga representative of the christian democratic peoples party applause the four youngest representatives lászló botka mszp tamás deutsch fidesz péter nahimi mdf and józsef rimóczi mszp i would like to ask the honorable parliament if they are aware of anything else are these data accurate no one applies  parliament to fulfill the duties of the cochairman dr i am asking representative lászló varga and the clerkship duties will be performed alternately by representatives lászló botka and tamás deutsch péter nahimi and józsef rimóczi i made the credentials available to the class president and the class registrars for the purpose of mandate examination with this i will hand over the leadership of the meeting to the cochairman of the parliament and the two consecutive coregistrars will be péter nahimi and józsef rimóczi applause  the president of the republic leaving the rostrum shakes hands with dr lászló varga who is standing at the steps of the platform and then takes his place according to the order of the meeting  the president of the quorum the quorum clerks and the secretary general of the national assembly take their place at the presidential rostrum

#> 1: mr president  parliament i gratefully accept the seniority due to my years but please dont take it as bias that  as a legacy to my transdanubian parents who farmed a few acres when i was young and lived on a tight budget my mother anna tóth born in egyházaskesző my father géza varga born in csorna and by the grace of the almighty  now  today i feel like a registrar fortyseven years ago i sat on the right side of the national assembly as a representative of the democratic peoples party the legal predecessor of todays christian democratic peoples party in the second postwar election campaign in  the democratic peoples party emerged victorious with sixtytwo representatives based on clear votes although we were the largest party in the country we could not think of forming a government because of the occupation we fought in the opposition so that citizens could exercise their fundamental rights without fear and freely that our culture would be strengthened that the creative individual should be the engine of our economic life we protected the fruits of labor private property  adding that every income includes social justice which ensures the decent life and human dignity of workers  furthermore that the education of the youth should be based on knowledge while their education should be based on the national spirit and christian values we could not achieve our goal because of the occupation and as the repression in the country intensified the anxiety of the citizens increased and then the moment came when we were already afraid i was afraid it was a cruel feeling to realize that life ends where fear begins there is only existence and we focused all our thoughts and nerves on getting rid of the lifesapping feeling of fear poverty is an undesirable state but in the course of history immortal works have been born in deprivation  never in fear because terror kills all creative forces the source of fear is arbitrariness and oppression against which our people move almost every hundred years in its history  i somewhat boldly list the xiii the golden bull era of the th century when the ruling orders protested against the arbitrariness of the king later the uprisings of antal nagy budai györgy dózsa ferenc tokaji then the freedom struggles of rákóczi and kossuth just like in  the struggles against arbitrariness and oppression the past and mentioned uprisings and freedom struggles have apparently failed in reality no because every noble selfless sacrificial act will bear fruit sooner or later and it will turn green even on the rock without kossuths struggle for freedom there is no compromise just as in  he decisively contributed to the collapse of the communist system but at the same time the whole world bowed down to hungarianness and we regained our national respect i pay tribute to all the legislators of  who fought for our nation such as istván barankovics secretary general of the democratic peoples party dr to sándor eckhardt university professor dr ferenc mateovics who is suffering from a terminal illness today he spent  and a half years in prison for his principles and when i asked him how he felt about those who caused his suffering he replied repent of your mistakes and sins and love your neighbors all i add to this behavior is that i respectfully bow my head before paul who became a saul i turn away from sauls who speak paul and i abhor sauls who live in hatred and revenge i also remember zoltán pfeiffer the president of the hungarian independence party imre kovács the author of the silent revolution anna kéthly a social democrat from the coalition government who as the vicepresident of the national assembly bravely and boldly defended the oppositions freedom of speech i think with grace of imre nagy the speaker of the national assembly whose opening speech was celebrated much more enthusiastically in the opposition than his own party we felt his hungarianness the love of his people he paid for it with his life i think with gratitude of all those who during our year history sacrificed their freedom and their lives for our nation and those who during the last  years of occupation  on any side  and who made it possible with their work during the four years that we are here today in an independent and free country to work for our nation i respectfully remember the present monsignor béla varga the former president of the national assembly whose whole life was work for his people prolonged applause  béla varga stands up to thank the applause we must democratically accept the results of the  elections but at least acknowledge them at the same time the newly formed government must also accept or at least acknowledge that power belongs to the people and that the governments only task is to serve the people citizens trust can only be enjoyed by those who preserve the independence of our country ensure the exercise of the peoples fundamental rights and the enforcement of social justice increase knowledge support education with a national spirit and the educational and educational work of the historic churches and last but not least during this period of the national assembly during the four years we will build the stronghold of our culture the national theatre or at least start building it our democracy is not strengthened by the power of the government but when citizens exercise their rights not only in elections and through their representatives but also in social advocacy cultural and other associations without it all governments are prone to arbitrariness president  parliament our people yearn for security internal peace and an improvement in our economic situation and they rightly demand selfless and sacrificial work from all representatives since no party has a panacea to solve all difficulties we must strive to reach an agreement on issues of public interest the security of our country is not currently guaranteed by international treaties and although we are not threatened by external threats due to the almost neverending cruel civil war in the former yugoslavia  and because the forces of power in the former soviet union have not yet been clarified  it is necessary that even the western european through the union or rather from nato we should get security so that we are not alone in case of danger our common cause is also the situation of minorities living outside our borders we are the same in their history language and culture so their fate is ours i think we agree that it is the duty of all of us in international documents such as the united nations general assembly l in its decision of december  to fight together for the rights granted to national minorities anyone who listens to this question will be hit by babits biblical judgment he who is silent is an accomplice among sinners the path of our economic improvement and development is marked by the european union of which there are still twelve today but soon the neighboring austria and three other countries will join which are often different in their history language and interests but by preserving their independence  and making sacrifices  the free man based on their business and production they live in peace democracy and satisfactory economic conditions the average annual income of citizens of the european union is more than huf one million our country is an associate member of the european union and we are moving towards full membership so we are also guided by the principles and results that promoted the development of the members of the european union these prove that the state is not a good farmer it is arbitrary bureaucratic slow and lacking in ideas keeping in mind the looming nationalization of the socialist system we still have to strive for the state to hand over everything it can to the entrepreneurial citizen and to keep only what is necessary and not the other way around in economic life unlimited liberalism the excesses and greed of the individual should be limited by social justice which is more than social security led by proportional and fair taxation a country is not rich where there are many millionaires  even if there are some  but where there are no destitutes and few unemployed villas and palaces may be built but the citizens of that country are contented and cheerful where everyone has their own home and young married people do not have to wait for years to spend the most beautiful period of their lives in their home in our colorful and rich language home means not only the apartment but also the homeland based on what has been said i believe that in a young democracy the voters do not want to listen to unnecessary battles of words nor do they want to see the empty fight between the government and the opposition but rather who does more for our people for this purpose it would be correct if the government accepted all the proposals of the opposition that serve the public good but at the same time the opposition should not protest against the governments legislative proposal the implementation of which is in the public interest we are all here because of the peoples trust trust is the most beautiful gift of life which we are only worthy of if we serve our nation selflessly and sacrificially let there be no one among us who obtains a financial advantage from his position as a representative if there is such a thing lets get rid of it because the voters want our work to benefit the country and not the representative in this spirit  with my wifes consent  i will use my representatives salary for the construction costs of the national theater and to help the needy applause  continuous noise one of the conditions for the countrys peace is that the nonarmed powerhouse of our time the electronic news service should not serve the government or the opposition but should inform the citizens objectively fairly and ethically this is the source of healthy public spirit  which is the spiritual current circulating between the government and the people  i believe that we also agree that we fight against all extremism the strength of the extremes is that they preach attractive truths but the goal is not to realize them but to gain power when they come to power they are silent about the truths and the arbitrariness of the legal guardian remains i am convinced that all members of the national assembly agree with me that there will be no reorganization in our country but i will add that it cannot be because the events that took place in the former socialist countries prove that development has passed through the outdated political system of communism its extinguished idea will not be rekindled and its economic system which has fallen into the abyss will not recover president  parliament the eyes of the citizens of our country are on us the hungarian minorities outside the borders as well as our compatriots living in emigration and making many sacrifices for our nation as well as european and overseas governments are also watching our activities it is our duty to protect the reputation of our country abroad and at home to fight our opposites in a noble struggle and the winner should not be a person a party the government or the opposition but our beloved country finally allow me to close this very rare occasion with a personal confession the struggles glory and defeats of our history my textbook i happily and abundantly draw from our culture which is contemporary with christianity our beautiful language is the only written and spoken expression of my thoughts in my difficulty my frailty my downfall christianity remained my guide i belong to this nation i am from the people i live among the people and i work for the people nazism put me in prison communism drove me away freedom brought me back i thank the heavens and all my loyal compatriots that i can finish my public work where i started at home thanks prolonged applause  parliament paragraph  of   of the constitution as well as lv  on the legal status of representatives of the national assembly the law provides for conflicts of interest related to the office of representative the representative group of the six parliamentary parties  if they allow me i wont use the word faction because i dont like it  agreed that at the inaugural meeting we should present the list of representatives who have a conflict of interest as well as the list of those who have eliminated the conflict of interest in the meantime i would like to ask my representative the age registrar to introduce the list
